            <h1>What is Cryptography?</h1>
            <img src="assets/img/cryptography.png" class="main-image">

            <p>Cryptography is the science of hiding or coding information so that only the intended recipient can read it. This ancient art has been used for thousands of years and continues to play a crucial role in modern digital security, from protecting bank card transactions to securing computer passwords and enabling safe ecommerce.</p>
            <p>Modern cryptography employs sophisticated algorithms and ciphers that enable the encryption and decryption of sensitive information. Advanced techniques like 128-bit and 256-bit encryption keys create codes that are considered virtually unbreakable. The Advanced Encryption Standard, commonly known as AES, represents the current gold standard in encryption technology and is widely trusted across industries for protecting confidential data.</p>

            <h2>Main Advantage of Cryptography</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><b>Enhanced Security and Privacy:</b> Cryptography provides robust protection for sensitive information by transforming readable data into encoded formats that unauthorized parties cannot decipher. Its primary advantages include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Confidentiality:</b> Ensures that private conversations and data remain accessible only to authorized individuals</li>
                    <li><b>Authentication:</b> Verifies the identity of message senders and confirms data hasn't been tampered with during transmission</li>
                    <li><b>Data Integrity:</b> Protects information from unauthorized alterations while in storage or transit</li>
                    <li><b>Nonrepudiation:</b> Prevents senders from denying they created or transmitted specific messages or documents</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2>Main Disadvantage of Cryptography</h2>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><b>Key Management Complexity:</b> The greatest challenge in cryptography lies in properly managing cryptographic keys. Potential vulnerabilities include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Weak or Improperly Generated Keys:</b> Keys created without sufficient randomness become easier targets for attackers</li>
                    <li><b>Insecure Key Storage:</b> Storing keys alongside protected data or in vulnerable locations increases breach risk</li>
                    <li><b>Key Reuse and Non-Rotation:</b> Using keys beyond their intended purpose or failing to update them regularly compromises security</li>
                    <li><b>Insider Threats:</b> Malicious employees with key access pose serious risks to encrypted systems</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A single compromised key can result in massive data breaches, regulatory penalties, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust.</p>
