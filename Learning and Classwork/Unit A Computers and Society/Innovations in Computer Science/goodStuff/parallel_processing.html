                <b>Parallel processing</b> is a method in computing of running two or more processors (CPUs) to handle separate parts of an overall task. 
                A complex task is divided into smaller parts using specialized software, each part assigned to a different processor. Once each processor 
                completes its portion, the software reassembles the results into a final output.
            </p>

            <h2>Main Advantage of Parallel Processing</h2>
            <p>
                The primary benefit is <b>speed</b>; breaking a task across multiple processors significantly reduces the time it takes to run a program. 
                Parallel processing also enables systems to tackle problems that would simply be impossible on a single processor, such as data mining of
                massive databases or analyzing multiple alternatives in artificial intelligence. It also scales impressively: massively parallel processing 
                systems can use hundreds or even thousands of processors working together efficiently. 
            </p>

            <h2>Main Disadvantage of Parallel Processing</h2>
            <p>
                The biggest drawback is programming complexity. Processors must stay in sync with one another regarding changes in data values, which is 
                technically difficult to manage. SMP machines are relatively simple to program, but MPP machines are not. Additional challenges include 
                resource contention, where simultaneous requests for shared resources can cause deadlock, effectively preventing programs from accessing what 
                they need. As more processors are added, propagation time (how long data takes to reach all parts of the system) also increases, eventually 
                diminishing the performance gains.
