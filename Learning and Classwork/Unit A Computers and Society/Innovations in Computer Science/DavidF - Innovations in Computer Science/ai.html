            <h1>What is Artificial Intelligence?</h1>
            <img src="assets/img/artificial-intelligence.png" class="main-image">

            <p>
                <b>Artificial intelligence (AI)</b> is a branch of computer science focused on creating systems that can perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence.
                These tasks include learning from data, recognizing patterns, reasoning, solving problems, understanding language, and making decisions. 
                Modern day AI technologies range from simple rule-based systems to advanced machine learning models that improve performance as they process 
                more data.

            <h2>Main Advantage of Computer Graphics</h2>
            <p>
                A key advantage of AI is its ability to increase <b>efficiency, accuracy, and productivity.</b> AI systems can process large volumes of data and 
                perform repetitive tasks much faster and with fewer errors than humans, work continuously without fatigue, and support better decision-making by 
                finding patterns in data that might be difficult for people to detect. This leads to benefits in many areas such as healthcare, finance, 
                transportation, and business operations. 
            </p>

            <h2>Main Disadvantage of Cryptography</h2>
            <p>
                A central disadvantage of AI is the <b>risk of job displacement and ethical challenges.</b> As AI automates routine work, some jobs may become obsolete, 
                requiring workers to retrain for new roles. In addition, AI systems can raise ethical issues like biased decision-making, privacy concerns, and 
                a lack of transparency in how they make decisions, which can lead to unfair outcomes if not managed responsibly.
